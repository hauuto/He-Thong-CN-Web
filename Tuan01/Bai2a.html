		<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

		<div>
		The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
			<b>Leonhard Euler</b>
			was born in Basel, Switzerland.
			There, he studied under another giant of mathematics,
			<b>Jean Bernoulli. </b>
			In 1731 Euler became a professor
			of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy
			of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific
			mathematician of all time, publishing over
			800 different books and papers. His influence was
			felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work
			on mathematical analysis,
			<i>Introduction in analysin infinitorum</i>
			(1748) remained a standard textbook
			for well over a century. For the princess of
			Anhalt-Dessau he wrote
			<i>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</i>
			(1768-1772), giving a clear
			non-technical outline of the main physical
			theories of the time.

		One can hardly do math without copying Euler.
			Notations still in use today, such as e and pi,
			were introduced in Euler's writings.
			He is perhaps best known for his
			research into mathematical analysis.
			Euler's formula

			<br>
			<math displays="inline">
				<mi>cos(x) + isin(x) = </mi>
				<msup>
					<mi>e</mi>
					<mi>(ix)</mi>
				</msup>
			</math>

			<br>
			<br>

			demonstrates the relationship between algebra,
			complex analysis, and trigonometry.
			From this equation, it's easy to derive the
			equation


			<br>
			<br>

			<math display = "inline">
				<msup>
					<mi>e</mi>
					<mi>(&Pi;1)</mi>
				</msup>
				<mo>+</mo>
				<mn>1</mn>
				<mo>=</mo>
				<mn>0</mn>
			</math>

			<br>
			<br>
			which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, 	&Pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.

			<br>
			<br>

			Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
